## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Add Required Libraries

In Apps Script, go to **Libraries** and add these by Bruce McPherson:

| Library | ID | Identifier | Description |
|---------|----|-----------| ----------- |
| **cGoa** | `1v_l4xN3ICa0lAW315NQEzAHPSoNiFdWHsMEwj2qA5t9cgZ5VWci2Qxv2` | `cGoa` | OAuth2 authentication |
| **cUseful** | `1EbLSESpiGkI3PYmJqWh3-rmLkYKAtCNPi1L2YCtMgo2Ut8xMThfJ41Ex` | `cUseful` | Utility functions |

> **Note**: cUseful is a dependency of cGoa, so adding cGoa should automatically include it.

### Step 2: Configure Script Properties

In **Project Settings > Script Properties**, add:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Your Box OAuth Client ID | From Box Developer Console |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Box OAuth Client Secret | From Box Developer Console |
| `VISION_API_KEY` | Your Google Cloud Vision API Key | Optional, for AI features |

### Step 3: Box Developer Console Setup

1. Create a Custom App in [Box Developer Console](https://developer.box.com/)
2. Set **Redirect URI** to: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/usercallback`
3. Enable scopes: **Read and write all files and folders**, **Manage enterprise properties**
4. Get Client ID and Secret for Script Properties

### Step 4: Initialize Authentication

Run this **once** to complete OAuth2 setup:

```javascript
initializeBoxAuth()
```

This will show you instructions to:
1. Deploy as web app (temporarily)
2. Visit the web app URL to authorize
3. Complete Box OAuth consent
4. Undeploy web app (optional)

### Step 5: Verify Setup

```javascript
testBoxGoaSetup()  // Comprehensive authentication test
testCompleteSetup() // Full system test
```

Update in `Config.gs`:

```javascript
const ACTIVE_TEST_FOLDER_ID = 'your_folder_id';  // For testing
const DEFAULT_PROCESSING_FOLDER_ID = '0';        // Root folder or specific ID
```

### Rate Limiting

Adjust delays in `Config.gs`:

```javascript
const ENHANCED_PROCESSING_BATCH_SIZE = 5;         // Files per batch
const ENHANCED_PROCESSING_FILE_DELAY_MS = 2000;   // Delay between files
const ENHANCED_PROCESSING_BATCH_DELAY_MS = 5000;  // Delay between batches
```

### Content Analysis Rules

Customize content categorization in `MetadataExtraction.gs`:

```javascript
// Add custom content type rules in ContentAnalyzer_.analyzeContent()
var contentRules = [
  {
    test: function() { return lowerPath.includes('your_keyword'); },
    apply: function() { analysis.contentType = 'your_type'; }
  }
  // Add more rules...
];
```

## Metadata Template Fields

The system creates a comprehensive metadata template with these categories:

- **üíº Business**: Usage rights, quality rating, importance *(Important stuff)*
- **üìã Processing**: Stage, version, review status *(Boxer's work log)*

## üö® When Boxer Needs Help (Troubleshooting)

### Authentication Issues *(Boxer can't get into the yard)*
```javascript
diagnoseBoxAuth(); // Check Boxer's credentials
testBoxAccess(); // Test if Boxer can say "hello" to Box
```

### Processing Issues *(Boxer is confused)*
```javascript
diagnoseFolderAccess(); // Check if Boxer can reach all areas
testComprehensiveMetadataExtraction(); // Test Boxer's sniffing abilities
```

### Vision API Issues *(Boxer's goggles are foggy)*  
```javascript
verifyVisionApiSetup(); // Clean Boxer's special goggles
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Boxer's Training Settings (Configuration Options)

### Processing Settings *(How Boxer works)*
Edit `Config.js` to customize:
- `ACTIVE_TEST_FOLDER_ID`: Boxer's favorite playground *(default: test folder)*
- `MAX_VISION_API_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`: How big toys Boxer can handle with goggles
- `PROCESSING_BATCH_SIZE`: How many toys Boxer carries at once
- Rate limiting delays *(Boxer's rest time)*

### Content Categorization *(Teaching Boxer new tricks)*
Modify `MetadataExtraction.js` to customize:
- Content type rules *(What different things look like)*
- Location keywords mapping *(Where things belong)*
- Department assignments *(Who owns what)*

## üéñÔ∏è Best Practices (Training Your Boxer Right)

### For Small Collections (<100 images) *(Boxer's cozy apartment)*
- Use `processBoxImagesEnhanced()` *(Boxer can handle everything easily)*
- Run every 6 hours *(Regular walks)*

### For Medium Collections (100-1000 images) *(Boxer's suburban house)*  
- Use `processBoxImagesOptimized()` *(Smart Boxer strategy)*
- Run every 2 hours *(Frequent yard patrols)*

### For Large Collections (1000+ images) *(Boxer's mansion with huge yard)*
- Use `processBoxImagesOptimized()` *(Essential smart strategy)*
- Run hourly *(Boxer is always on duty)*
- Monitor with `showOptimizedProcessingStats()` *(Check on Boxer regularly)*

### Performance Tips *(Keeping Boxer healthy and happy)*
- Vision API has daily quotas - monitor usage *(Don't overwork Boxer's special goggles)*
- Large files (>20MB) are skipped for AI analysis *(Some toys are too big for the goggles)*
- Processing stages track completion to avoid reprocessing *(Boxer remembers what he's already done)*

## üìÖ Scheduled Trigger Recommendation (Boxer's Daily Schedule)

**üèÜ Use this function for your scheduled trigger**: `processBoxImagesOptimized`

This function makes Boxer the smartest pup because he automatically adapts his strategy based on:
- Time since last patrol *(How long since Boxer's last walk)*
- Account size and activity *(Size of the yard and how busy it is)*
- Processing history *(What Boxer learned from previous rounds)*

Set trigger frequency based on your yard size:
- **Small**: Every 6 hours *(Relaxed suburban dog)*
- **Medium**: Every 2 hours *(Active neighborhood watch dog)*
- **Large**: Every hour *(Professional guard dog)*

## üêï‚Äçü¶∫ Support (When You Need to Call the Vet)

This script uses Bruce McPherson's excellent cGoa and cUseful libraries for robust OAuth and utility functions *(Boxer's professional training tools)*. 

When Boxer needs help:
1. Check the Apps Script logs *(Boxer's diary)*
2. Run diagnostic functions *(Boxer's health checkup)*
3. Verify Box app permissions *(Make sure Boxer can access his territory)*
4. Confirm API keys are correct *(Check Boxer's ID tags)*

*Remember: Boxer is a good dog who wants to help! If he's not performing well, it's usually because he needs clearer instructions or his tools need adjustment.* üêï‚ù§Ô∏è

## üìú License

This is a utility script for personal/organizational use. Uses open-source libraries by Bruce McPherson. 

*Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and lots of virtual dog treats.* ü¶¥
